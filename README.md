# GameHub — Backend

Spring Boot backend for **GameHub**, a social network for video games. Started as a project for
the "Large-Scale and Multi-Structured Databases" course at the University of Pisa (the course's
repo, now archived, is [`LSMSD-Project`](https://github.com/tonipatania/LSMSD-Project)) and
developed solo since — a study in polyglot persistence: **MongoDB** stores the core entities
(users, games, reviews), while **Neo4j** models the social graph (follows, wishlist, likes,
friend/game suggestions).

Frontend companion project: [`gameHub-FE`](https://github.com/tonipatania/gameHub-FE) (Angular).

## Stack

- Java 17, Spring Boot 3.5
- Spring Security + JWT (`io.jsonwebtoken`)
- Spring Data MongoDB (reactive) — document storage
- Spring Data Neo4j / Neo4j OGM — graph storage
- ModelMapper, Lombok

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17+
- MongoDB running on `localhost:27017`
- Neo4j running on `localhost:7687` (Bolt)

Connection settings live in
[`src/main/resources/application.properties`](src/main/resources/application.properties).
With no `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` set (the local case), the `dev` profile
([`application-dev.properties`](src/main/resources/application-dev.properties)) is active
by default and supplies the local Neo4j password (`elliejoel`, matching `docker-compose.yml`) and
a JWT signing secret for local use only. In production (`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`, see
[`DEPLOY.md`](../DEPLOY.md)) neither has a fallback — the app refuses to start unless
`NEO4J_PASSWORD` and `GAMEHUB_JWT_SECRET` are set as real environment variables.

Account confirmation emails are sent via the [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com) transactional email
API (HTTPS, free tier 300/day — not SMTP, so it isn't affected by hosts that block outbound SMTP
ports). Set `GAMEHUB_BREVO_API_KEY` (a transactional API key from the Brevo dashboard, under
SMTP & API > API Keys) and `GAMEHUB_MAIL_FROM` (a sender address verified in the Brevo dashboard
under Senders, Domains & Dedicated IPs > Senders). Without them, registration still succeeds but
the confirmation email fails to send (logged, not thrown) and the account stays unconfirmed until
a link can be issued.

## Running

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The API is served on `http://localhost:8080`. A Postman collection is available under
[`postman/`](postman) for manual testing.

## Database structure

### MongoDB (`game` database)

| Collection | Description |
|---|---|
| `users` | `username` (unique), `name`, `surname`, `password` (BCrypt after first login), `email` (unique), `role` |
| `games` | `name`, `genres`, `releaseDate`, `avgScore` (average `Userscore` of reviews sharing the game's name, 0 if none), `price`, description, store metadata (`URL`, developers, publishers, categories, supported languages), and an embedded `reviews` list (top 20 by `likeCount`, used as a read cache — see `GameService`) |
| `reviews` | `title`, `userScore`, `comment`, `username`, `likeCount` |

Indexes: unique index on `users.username` and `users.email`; index on `games.genres` and
`games.avgScore`, plus a compound index `{genres: 1, avgScore: 1}` used by the catalog
search/filter endpoints.

### Neo4j (graph model)

Nodes:

- `UserNeo4j {id, username}`
- `GameNeo4j {id, name}`
- `ReviewNeo4j {id}`

Relationships:

| Relationship | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `(User)-[:FOLLOW]->(User)` | social follow graph |
| `(User)-[:ADD]->(Game)` | wishlist / owned games — also used to compute game and friend suggestions via 2nd-degree traversal |
| `(User)-[:LIKE]->(Review)` | review likes |

Constraints/indexes (created at startup by
[`Neo4jIndexInitializer`](src/main/java/it/unipi/lsmsd/gamehub/utils/Neo4jIndexInitializer.java)):
uniqueness constraint on `UserNeo4j.username`, plus indexes on `UserNeo4j.id`, `GameNeo4j.name`,
`GameNeo4j.id`, `ReviewNeo4j.id`.

Dataset scale: 83,554 games, 279,883 reviews, 131,757 users in MongoDB; 83,554 `GameNeo4j`,
131,757 `UserNeo4j`, 98,557 `ReviewNeo4j` nodes, 147,597 `ADD` and 482,172 `FOLLOW`
relationships in Neo4j — node counts match 1:1 across the two stores, with no orphan or
duplicate nodes.

A couple of properties of the data worth knowing before writing queries against it:

- **Usernames are unique; game names are not.** The catalog legitimately contains distinct
  games (different `_id`, release date, developer) that share a title, so lookups by
  name/title — `findByTitleOrderByLikeCountDesc`, and the review↔game linking in general —
  can match more than one document by design.
- **Reviews link to their game by title, not by id** (there's no `gameId` field on `Review`).
  A minority of reviews have an empty `Title` and are therefore not attributable to any game;
  they're excluded when computing `avgScore` but are otherwise valid rows.

## Importing a dump (optional)

This repo doesn't include a dataset — the original course dump contained real user emails and
password hashes, so it was never meant to be redistributed from here. Without one, the app still
runs fine against empty databases (signup/login, reviews, etc. all work; the catalog just starts
empty). If you have your own MongoDB/Neo4j dumps in the shapes described above, here's how to
load them.

### MongoDB

With `games`/`reviews`/`users` BSON dumps, a MongoDB container named `mongo_local`, and the dump
copied into `/tmp/dump` inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it mongo_local mkdir -p /tmp/dump/game
docker exec -it mongo_local sh -c "mv /tmp/dump/*.bson /tmp/dump/*.json /tmp/dump/game/"
docker exec -it mongo_local mongorestore --nsInclude="game.*" /tmp/dump/
```

Adjust the container name/copy step if you're restoring from a different setup — the key
requirement is that `mongorestore` sees a `game/` folder containing the `.bson`/`.metadata.json`
pairs.

### Neo4j

With a `neo4j.dump` file: `neo4j-admin database load` cannot run against a live database, so the
target Neo4j container must be stopped and the dump loaded via a disposable container mounting
the **same** data volume:

```bash
# 1. Stop the running Neo4j container
docker stop neo4j_local

# 2. Load the dump into the same data volume with a throwaway container
docker run --rm \
  --volume=<path-to-neo4j-data-volume>:/data \
  --volume=<path-to-folder-containing-neo4j.dump>:/dumps \
  neo4j:latest \
  neo4j-admin database load neo4j --from-path=/dumps --overwrite-destination=true

# 3. Restart the original container
docker start neo4j_local

# 4. Verify the import
docker exec neo4j_local cypher-shell -u neo4j -p elliejoel \
  "MATCH (n) RETURN labels(n) AS label, count(*) AS count;"
```

`--from-path` must point to the **folder** containing the dump, not the file itself, and the
target database name (`neo4j`) must match the dump's file name (`neo4j.dump`).
`--overwrite-destination=true` replaces whatever is currently in that data volume.
