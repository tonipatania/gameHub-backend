name: backend-e2e-tests
description: Write JUnit 5 end-to-end tests for the gameHub Spring Boot backend that drive full multi-step user journeys over real HTTP (RestAssured, random port, real Testcontainers Mongo/Neo4j) - signup, login, using the returned JWT to call protected endpoints, following a flow across several endpoints. Use whenever the user asks for end-to-end tests, e2e tests, "full flow"/"user journey" tests, or wants to verify the whole app works together through the real HTTP surface rather than one layer at a time.

## Relationship to the other test skills

- **`backend-tests`** (unit, mocked repositories) and **`backend-integration-tests`** (real DB,
  one layer/flow at a time, often via `MockMvc` or direct service/repository calls) both go deep
  on a single piece of logic. This skill goes wide: a realistic sequence of HTTP calls a real
  client would make, asserting on the observable behavior of the whole system. If a task is about
  one endpoint's edge cases, it probably belongs in one of the other two skills instead - don't
  reach for a full HTTP journey just to check a single validation branch.
- Use `backend-integration-tests`' `IntegrationTestSupport` machinery (shared Testcontainers,
  `mongoTemplate`/`neo4jClient` for fixture seeding and DB-state assertions) - this skill's base
  class extends it, so read that skill's "Base class" section too; it isn't repeated here.

## Where tests go and how they're run

Class name **must end in `IT`** (Maven Failsafe convention - see `backend-integration-tests` for
why), and by further convention here, name it after the journey with an `E2E` marker before `IT`
so it's visually distinct from a lower-level integration test in a directory listing, e.g.
`AuthJourneyE2EIT`, `ReviewJourneyE2EIT`, `SocialGraphJourneyE2EIT`. Put these directly under
`src/test/java/it/unipi/lsmsd/gamehub/e2e/` (a flat package for journeys, since a journey usually
spans several controllers/packages and doesn't belong to any single one of them) rather than
mirroring the main package layout the other two skills use.

## Base class: extend `support.E2ETestSupport`

`src/test/java/it/unipi/lsmsd/gamehub/support/E2ETestSupport.java`:

- `@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = RANDOM_PORT)`, extends `IntegrationTestSupport` (real
  Testcontainers Mongo/Neo4j, per-test cleanup - see that skill).
- Configures `RestAssured.baseURI`/`port` from `@LocalServerPort` in a `@BeforeEach`, so tests just
  call `given()...when()...then()` (static imports from `io.restassured.RestAssured.given`)
  directly, or use the two helpers below.
- `protected RequestSpecification authenticatedAs(String username, String role)` - mints a JWT via
  the real `JwtService` bean and returns a RestAssured spec with the `Authorization: Bearer ...`
  header already set. `role` is the raw claim (`"USER"`/`"ADMIN"`, no `ROLE_` prefix -
  `JwtAuthenticationFilter` adds that itself when building the Spring Security authority).
  Use this for any step in a journey that isn't specifically testing `/login` itself - no need to
  seed a BCrypt password and actually call `/login` just to get authenticated for a later step.
- `protected RequestSpecification anonymous()` - a plain spec, for asserting a protected endpoint
  correctly 401s without a token.

## Writing a journey

A journey test seeds only what a real client couldn't create through the API itself (e.g. an
existing `Game`/`UserNeo4j` a wishlist step needs to already exist), then drives the rest purely
through HTTP calls in sequence, asserting on each response before using its output (e.g. an id or
token) in the next call. Keep assertions on *status code and JSON shape*, matching what
`backend-tests`' controller-layer guidance already documents for each endpoint (see that skill and
`CLAUDE.md`'s "Layering"/"Auth" sections for the exact status codes/DTOs) - re-verifying business
rules already covered by unit tests inside a journey just makes it slower and more brittle without
adding coverage; the journey's job is proving the steps compose correctly end-to-end.

Two structural traps specific to this codebase, worth checking explicitly in a journey rather than
assuming:

- **Graph nodes must exist before graph relationships can be created.** `followUser`,
  `addGameToWishlist`, etc. return a "no-op" success-shaped response (not an error) if either side
  isn't already a `UserNeo4j`/`GameNeo4j` node - there's no cross-store validation that raises an
  error. A journey that does signup → follow-a-friend needs the friend to already be a `UserNeo4j`
  node - registering the friend through `/signup` creates it as a side effect (see
  `LoginController.registration()`), or seed the node directly via `neo4jClient` - or the follow
  step will silently "succeed" while doing nothing - assert the follow relationship actually landed
  (query `neo4jClient`, or call `GET /user/followedUser`) rather than trusting the 200.
- **The `{userId}`-suffixed "admin" endpoints are gated by `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`,
  on the caller's own JWT role claim.** Endpoints like `POST /game/create/{userId}` or
  `DELETE /review/reviewSelected/delete/{userId}` keep `{userId}` in the path for logging only -
  it plays no role in the authorization decision. To exercise the admin-allowed branch, mint the
  token with `authenticatedAs(username, "ADMIN")`; a `"USER"`-role token gets 403 regardless of
  what `{userId}` is passed. (Previously the admin check was an application-level lookup of the
  Mongo `User` document whose `_id` equalled the `{userId}` path segment, completely ignoring the
  caller's own identity/role - that let any authenticated user reach admin functionality just by
  discovering another user's Mongo id, e.g. via `GET /user/search`. Fixed by moving the check to
  `@PreAuthorize` on the controller methods; see `SecurityConfig`'s `@EnableMethodSecurity`.)
  `POST /user/loadgames` was and remains a real `hasRole("ADMIN")` check at the Security-filter
  layer instead of `@PreAuthorize` (test it the same way: `authenticatedAs(username, "ADMIN")` vs
  `"USER"`, asserting 200 vs 403). `/user/sync` used to be another admin endpoint but was removed -
  it let anyone with an ADMIN token trigger an unbounded full Mongo→Neo4j user resync on demand,
  which had no place in a production endpoint.
- **Every mutating endpoint that acts on a specific user (wishlist, review likes, follow/unfollow,
  username rename, review creation) takes the actor's identity from `@AuthenticationPrincipal`,
  never from a request parameter.** `POST /user/wishlist/addWishlistGame`,
  `POST /user/userSelected/follow` (the `followerUsername` side), `PATCH /user/updateUser` (the
  `username` being renamed), `POST /review/gameSelected/create` (the review's author), etc. all
  ignore any client-supplied value for "who is doing this" and use the authenticated JWT subject
  instead - so a journey step exercising one of these must authenticate *as* the user whose data
  it expects to change; authenticating as one user and passing another user's identity as a
  parameter is a no-op/IDOR test, not a valid journey step. (Previously several of these trusted
  the client-supplied value outright, letting any authenticated user act on any other user's
  wishlist/likes/follows/account/reviews.)

## Before calling a task done

Same as `backend-integration-tests` (read that skill's "Before calling a test task done" section -
not repeated here): run `./mvnw verify` from the repo root (needs Docker and `mongo_local`/
`neo4j_local` already running for the pre-existing unit suite that runs first; Testcontainers
itself pulls fresh, disposable `mongo:7.0`/`neo4j:5.15` images and never touches those dev
containers), confirm green, and let/watch the Stop hook handle Checkstyle/Spotless on changed
files.
