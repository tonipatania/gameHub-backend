# Claude Code Stop hook: after Claude finishes a turn, format + lint any
# .java files that changed (staged, unstaged, or new/untracked).
# Complements .githooks/pre-commit, which runs the same checks at commit time.
#
# Contract: on violations, prints {"decision":"block","reason":"..."} to stdout
# so Claude Code keeps the turn open and feeds the Checkstyle output back to
# Claude instead of letting the turn end silently.
